### Hi there 👋, I'm Martin-Philipp!

Currently, I am a Group Leader for the Sales Technical Back Office at Bosch Home Comfort. Among other things, we design HVAC systems of all complexity levels for our customers. My goal is to make my team shine by leveraging my knowledge of efficient processes, AI, and software engineering to drive continuous improvements in our overall performance. Together, we are dedicated to delivering innovative and tailored solutions that address the unique needs of our customers.
Previously, I worked as Executive Assistant to the COO/CTO of Bosch Home Comfort. In 2019, I started at Bosch as a Trainee in the Junior Managers Programm with a focus on AI and IoT. I want to become a leader in my field to shape solutions at the intersection of data, consumer centricity & sales to help customers, amaze them and improve their life.
