### Hi there 👋, I'm Martin-Philipp!

Currently, I am a Group Leader for the Sales Technical Back Office at Bosch Thermotechnology. Among other things, we design HVAC systems of all complexity levels for our customers. My goal is to drive our sales process & technical support to be the best version of itself and I am committed to empowering my talented team to achieve success.
Previously, I worked as Executive Assistant to the COO/CTO of Bosch Thermotechnology. In 2019, I started at Bosch as a Trainee in the Junior Managers Programm with a focus on AI and IoT. I want to become a leader in my field to shape solutions at the intersection of data, consumer centricity & sales tech to help customers, amaze them and improve their life.
